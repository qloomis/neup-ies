This is a private repository for sharing code and project files.

*Note from Gabriel: If cloning onto a local machine, I recommend that this repository be cloned into a directory alongside the SAM projects (LK, WEX, SSC, SAM). That is, the **neup-ies** folder should be in the same directory as **lk**, **ssc**, **googletest**, etc.*
