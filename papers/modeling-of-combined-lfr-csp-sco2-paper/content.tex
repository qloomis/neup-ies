\subsection{Cycle Component Modeling}
%======================================================================================
Components present in the cycles are modeled using various techniques. Turbines and compressors are analyzed using isentropic efficiencies. Counter flow heat exchangers use the effectiveness-NTU method while black box heat exchangers use a simple energy balance for state point calculations. The lead-cooled fast reactor is assumed to be a black box heat exchanger because of the constant heat input and state points on the sCO$_2$ inlet and outlet are provided. The concentrating solar power cycle is modeled with necessary components including hot and cold TES, reciever, pumps and counter flow heat exchangers.


\subsubsection{Turbines and Compressors }
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The modeled cycles have a number of compressors and turbines. The turbines and compressors are modeled for each cycle using constant isentropic efficiency values summarized in Table \ref{tab-cycle-constants}. Turbines take the high pressure sCO$_2$ and expand it through a series of blades allowing a production of energy, while compressors input mechanical energy to increase the pressure of the sCO$_2$. The turbines and compressors are assumed to be at steady state, exchange no heat with the surroundings, and have a single inlet and outlet. Power calculations are initially done on ideal, reversible compressors or turbines then are scaled by the isentropic efficiencies to provide an estimate for a realizable component. Using this estimate, along with a known low and high side pressures, temperature and enthalpy outlets of the turbine and compressor can be calculated \cite{klein_nellis_2011}. 

\subsubsection{Black Box and Counter Flow Heat Exchangers}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Black box heat exchangers are simplified heat exchangers which have no approach temperature or pinch point. These heat exchangers use an energy balance with mass flow inlet energy, heat input or output, and mass flow outlet energy. The energy balance equation used for all black box heat exchangers is Equation \ref{eq-black}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq-black}
    \dot{m}_{in}*h_{in} + \dot{Q}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}*h_{out} + \dot{Q}_{out},
\end{equation}

In this equation the energy input to the system is on the left hand side with $\dot{m}_{in}$ multiplied by $h_{in}$ being energy from the mass flow and $\dot{Q}_{in}$ being heat transfer directly to the flow from an outside source. The right hand side of the equation is heat leaving the energy balance. The mass flow leaving is $\dot{m}_{out}$ with enthalpy of $h_{out}$ and $\dot{Q}_{out}$ is the heat transfer leaving from the flow. Black box energy balances are used in three situations, the Reciever, LFR HX, and PC HX. These heat exchangers are not exchaustively modeled because the state points on the inlet and outlet are constrained by design parameters.

Counter flow heat exchangers are modeled with two fluids flowing in opposite directions exchanging heat from the hot side to the cold side. The temperatures of the hot and cold flows on either side of the the heat exchanger have a temperature difference known as an approach temperature. A diagram showing a simplified example of a counterflow heat exchanger is illustrated in Figure \ref{counter-flow-hx}.

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H] 
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=10 cm]{Definitions/counter-flow-hx.pdf}
    \caption{Simple counter flow heat exchanger diagram. \label{counter-flow-hx}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

Additional assumptions of the counter flow heat exchanger model are no heat loss to the surroundings, $\dot{Q}_{surr}$ is zero, and no pressure drops accross the heat exchangers. Counter flow heat exchanger calculations require two known state points, fluid libraries, mass flow rate of hot and cold side, and a specified approach temperature. In all of the modeled cases, the approach temperature is set to a value of 10 K. The fluid libraries referenced are built into EES for Carbon Dioxide and Salt(60\% NaNO3 40\% KNO3) \cite{pacheco_1995_salt_properties,roland_1996_co2_properties}. 

To analyze the counter flow heat exchanger a side is chosen, usually high, to start the calculations. The approach temperature is initially subtracted from the hot stream on the high side to find the missing cold temperature according to Equation \ref{temp_h}. 

\begin{equation}
   \label{temp_h}
    T_{out,c} = T_{in,h}-\Delta_{T},
\end{equation}

Where T$_{out,c}$ is the cold stream outlet temperature and T$_{in,h}$ is the hot stream inlet temperature. Knowing the two state points allows for the enthalpy to be found using correlations from the fluid property libraries.

\subsubsection{Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lead-cooled fast reactors use energy from a controlled nuclear reaction to heat molten lead. This lead is used to both cool the core as well as transfer heat into the sCO$_2$ Brayton power cycle \cite{smith_2016_lfr_background,alemberti_2013_lfr_overview}. The lead-cooled fast reactor is assumed to be a black box heat transfer and is labeled in the cycle models LFR HX. The inlet, outlet and heat transfer rates are defined by our industry partner, Westinghouse Electric Company making the black box simplification viable. The energy balance for the black box assumption can be seen in Equation \ref{eq-lfr-black-box}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq-lfr-black-box}
    \dot{m}_{inlet}*h_{inlet} + \dot{Q}_{LFRHX} = \dot{m}_{outlet}*h_{outlet},
\end{equation}

Where the left hand side, $\dot{m}_{inlet}$, $h_{inlet}$, and $\dot{Q}_{LFRHX}$, is the energy into the flow and the right hand side, $\dot{m}_{outlet}$ and $h_{outlet}$, is the energy brought out from the flow of sCO$_2$. The amount of energy transfered into the cycle, $\dot{Q}_{LFRHX}$, is set at 950 MW, and outlet temperature of the sCO$_2$ from the LFR HX is set at a value of 595$^{\circ}$C. The outlet temperature of the LFR is rigid due to high temperature material limits on the LFR lead side. Low sCO$_2$ LFR inlet temperature has a lower limit of 340$^{\circ}$C and an optimal value of 400$^{\circ}$C. Increasing this temperature above this optimal value leads to diminishing returns on the LFR efficiency.


\subsubsection{Concentrating Solar Power Cycle}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSP salt cycle modeled in this paper is composed of hot and cold thermal energy storage (TES), pumps, receiver, sCO$_2$-to-Salt counter flow heat exchanger (C2S), and CSP counter flow heat exchanger (CSP HX). The diagram for this CSP salt cycle is seen in Figure \ref{csp}. 

\end{paracol}
%MW: Best practice is to allow figures to float. To do this, specify the location as [htb] ("here, top, or bottom"). I've done a search-replace for all figures to do this. 
\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption{Diagram for CSP cycle with cold and hot thermal energy storage, pumps, and csp black box heat input\label{csp}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

The CSP salt cycle uses 60\% sodium nitrate and 40\% potassium nitrate 'solar salt' as the heat transfer fluid. Solar salt stored in the hot TES can be dispatched on demand through the CSP HX when grid demand increases and held when grid demand is low. Current CSP salt cycles heat solar salt with receivers and store it in hot TES tanks at 565$^{\circ}$C. Future CSP salt cycles are hypothesized to have bulk hot TES temperatures of up to 720$^{\circ}$C, but due to high temperature limitations with the LFR outlet, the hot TES temperature is set at 595$^{\circ}$C for all modeled cycles \cite{mehos2017concentrating}. The cold TES temperature takes on three different values according to cycle configuration capabilitites: 390$^{\circ}$C, 410$^{\circ}$C, and 440$^{\circ}$C. In addition to the lower hot TES temperature, current CSP salt cycles lack a secondary option for charging the hot TES \cite{hamilton2020dispatch}. The studied CSP salt cycle has two TES charging options: a receiver, which generates heat from a heliostat field, and C2S heat exchanger, which draws excess heat from the sCO$_2$ Brayton cycle. It is assumed that only one hot TES charging option can be active at any given time. 

The C2S heat exchanger is active during the 'charging' cycle configurations, when the focus is on heat storage for later use. During this process there is no solar salt flow through the receiver. Pump 1 is active moving solar salt from cold TES to hot TES through the C2S heat exchanger, which is extracting heat from the sCO$_2$ Brayton cycle. 

'Non-charging' cycle configurations has the receiver charging the hot TES, C2S heat exchanger is not transfering heat, and the LFR is dispatching energy directly into electrical generation. When electrical generation is occuring, the heat input in this cycle is modelled through a black box energy balance across states S6-A and S1-A with a heat addition of 7.5e8 W from the heliostat field. The hot storage is moved through Pump 3 and transfers heat into the sCO$_{2}$ Brayton cycle to be converted into electricity. The cooled salt is stored in cold storage and moved through Pump 2 where the heat addition from the receiver is added.



\subsection{Generalization of Cycle Modeling}
%======================================================================================

The cycles presented are generalized in order to draw a more direct comparison. The generalized parameters include isentropic efficiencies, heat exchanger approach temperatures, pressures, heat input, and pump constants. These values are summarized in Table \ref{tab-cycle-constants}.

The values displayed in Table \ref{tab-cycle-constants} are representative of LFR and CSP design while being consistent with design parameters given by our industry partner, Westinghouse Electric Company. 

In addition to generalized parameters, all cycles have identical recompression sides. The recompression side contains a PreCooler, Low Temperature Recuperator, and two compressors; Main Compressor and ReCompressor.

Modeled cycles are summarized in Table \ref{tab-cycle_sum}.

\subsection{Non-Charging Cycle Configurations} 
%======================================================================================

Various cycles are modeled to test their advantages and disadvantages. These cycle models fall into two categories: non-charging and charging. The non-charging category is used to determine the configuration of the cycle with a focus on electricity generation. This includes the number and location of turbines, recuperators, and heat input to the system by the CSP and LFR. To quantify the effectiveness of the non-charging configurations, a cycle efficiency, $\eta_{cycle}$, is defined in Equation \ref{eq-eta-cycle}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq-eta-cycle}
    \eta_{cycle} = \frac{\dot{W}_{T}-\dot{W}_{MC}-\dot{W}_{RC}}{\dot{Q}_{LFRHX}+\dot{Q}_{CSPHX}},
\end{equation}

The numerator in Equation \ref{eq-eta-cycle} is the Alternator power, or the power produced from the turbines, $\dot{W}_{T}$, minus the required power of the compressors, $\dot{W}_{MC}$ and $\dot{W}_{RC}$. The denominator is the total power input into the system from the LFR HX, $\dot{Q}_{LFRHX}$, and CSP HX, $\dot{Q}_{CSPHX}$.


\subsubsection{Two-Cycle Configuration: C-LFR-ON and C-CSP-ON} %--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two-cycle configuration that is tested has independent sCO$_{2}$ loops bridged by a CSP cycle. This cycle has two sCO$_{2}$ Brayton Cycles: C-LFR-ON and C-CSP-ON. Configuration of components for these two cycles is identical with the exception of heat inputs. C-LFR-ON has heat provided from a LFR while C-CSP-ON has heat provided from the CSP. These two cycles individually operate when the focus of plant operation is primarily electricity generation.

The cycle that is using the LFR heat input in the two-cycle configuration is labeled as C-LFR-ON and the cycle diagram is illustrated in Figure \ref{c-lfr-on}.

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H] 
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Definitions/c-lfr-on.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram for C-LFR-ON with focus on electricity generation\label{c-lfr-on}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

Two seperate sensitivity studies on the LFR inlet temperature are completed for C-LFR-ON. The unconstrained study is performed by gradually increasing the mass flow to the main compressor while maximizing cycle efficiency. The constrained study is calculated by setting the LFR inlet temperature to the design value of 673.2 K (400$^{\circ}$C), which is a requirement of the LFR primary circuit to maximize power output within material limits.
%BL: flip the order of this para: constrained then unconstrained. State that the unconstrained is a 'sensitivty' case to determine the penalty of the constraint

The cycle that is using the CSP heat input in the two-cycle configuration is labeled C-CSP-ON and the cycle diagram is shown in Figure \ref{c-csp-on}. 

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H] 
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Definitions/c-csp-on.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram for C-CSP-ON with focus on electricity generation\label{c-csp-on}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

 Due to the individual operation while the cycles are generating electricity, C-CSP-ON is not directly impacted by the LFR low end temperatures. Instead, a sensitivity study is done on the temperature of the cold TES. Two temperatures are tested, 663.2 K and 713.2 K, to observe the impact of cold TES temperature on cycle efficiency. 


\subsubsection{C-1HTR1T-ON} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One drawback of having a two-cycle design, as seen in the C-LFR-ON and C-CSP-ON, is doubling the number of system components. Combining the two cycles into one would reduce redundancy and complexity. Heat addition from the CSP HX and LFR HX in parallel orientation is therefore studied in the C-1HTR1T-ON model. This model studies what impact mixing different temperature flows prior to the turbine has on cycle efficiency. The diagram for this cycle is illustrated in Figure \ref{c-1htr1t-on}.

%BL: be clear that Salt HX links back into the sCO2 cycle (e.g. parallel to 5-6) but is not shown to simplify the diagram. Otherwise people will wonder where it is coming from

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H] 
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Definitions/c-1htr1t-on.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram for C-1HTR1T-ON with focus on electricity generation\label{c-1htr1t-on}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

In this cycle, the LFR HX and CSP HX have identical inlet temperatures due to splitting the flow prior to their parallel orientation. Therefore, three sensitivity studies are done on the C-1HTR1T-ON EES model. The initial two studies have the low LFR temperature constrained to the value of 673.2 K with varied cold CSP TES and maximized cycle efficiency. The two tested values for cold CSP TES with constrained LFR low temperature are 683.2 K and 713.2 K. The desired cold CSP TES temperature of 663.2 K is not possible with the constraint on the LFR low temperature (because it cannot be colder than the sCO$_2$ that removes heat from the salt). In this case, to obtain the desired cold CSP TES temperature, the constraint on the LFR low temperature is removed, droping the temperature of the LFR inlet to 653.2 K. 
%BL: I think I understand what you're talking about but the above para could spell out all the sensitivity cases a bit more clearly, perhaps as bullets. Asp you will want to explain the criteria that go into cold storage temp. Lower = more delta T = more dispatchability


\subsubsection{C-2HTR3T-ON} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mixing two different temperature flows before the turbine in a Brayton cycle has a negative effect on cycle efficiency. To quantify the reduction in cycle efficiency, another cycle with no mixing prior to the turbine is desired. This cycle, C-2HTR3T-ON, can be seen in Figure \ref{c-2htr3t-on} and has two high temperature recuperators and three turbines. The LFR is powering one turbine, T1, and recuperating heat through a dedicated high temperature recuperator, HTR1. The CSP cycle also contains two separate turbines, T2, while having a dedicated high temperature recuperator, HTR2. After the high temperature recuperators, the two flows are combined and sent to the LTR hot side. 
%BL: this is more about having a compromise option of intermediate complexity and efficiency

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Definitions/c-2htr3t-on.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram for C-2HTR3T-ON with focus on electricity generation\label{c-2htr3t-on}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

Three sensitivity studies are done on the C-2HTR3T-ON model. Two with the LFR low temperature constrained and one without this constraint. The two constrained studies had varied cold CSP TES temperature with the lowest temperature of 663.2 K and highest temperature of 713.2 K. The unconstrained low LFR inlet study is calculated at a cold CSP TES temperature of 663.2 K.  
%BL: this is clearer than the previous one but bullets could still be useful



\subsection{Thermal Energy Storage Charging Techniques} 
%======================================================================================

Charging cycle configurations focus on an energy storage operating mode. These configurations test the optimal location of LFR heat extraction through the SALT HX. To maximize the available heat for extraction, alternator power is set to zero and turbine power is therefore equal to the compressors' demand. The excess energy from the LFR is thermally stored in the TES for later use when grid demand increases. Comparison of where thermal energy is extracted in the cycle is done by using the same Brayton cycle, C-LFR-ON, and configuring the salt heat exchanger in different locations around the turbine. To quantify the effectiveness of TES charging techniques a heat storage efficiency, $\eta_{heatstorage}$, is defined by Equation \ref{eq-eta-heatstorage}.
%BL: explain that as a (re)compression cycle is still being run for the LFR and the components are not perfectly efficient, it will consume power moving the fluid around that needs to be balanced with some of the thermal output

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq-eta-heatstorage}
    \eta_{heatstorage} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{C2S}}{\dot{Q}_{LFRHX}+\dot{Q}_{CSPHX}},
\end{equation}

Whereas $\dot{Q}_{S2C}$ is the amount of heat transfered through S2C and the addition of $\dot{Q}_{LFRHX}$ and $\dot{Q}_{CSPHX}$ is the total amount of heat input into the system from the LFR HX and CSP HX.

\subsubsection{C-LFR-PRE} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow leaving the turbine contains excess thermal energy that is not transformed into electrical energy. This excess thermal energy is stored in the hot CSP TES. The diagram outlining this process is C-LFR-PRE in Fig. \ref{c-lfr-pre}.  

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Definitions/c-lfr-pre.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram for C-LFR-PRE thermal energy storage charging orientation\label{c-lfr-pre}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

Problems arise with this salt charging configuration. The temperature out of the turbine is not high enough to charge the hot CSP TES to the required value of 833.2 K. To raise the temperature, some of the high temperature flow before the turbine is redirected through a valve and combined after the turbine. Combining different temperature flows and reducing the flow through the turbine has a large impact on heat storage efficiency. 



\subsubsection{C-LFR-POST} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving the heat extraction prior to the turbine is analyzed in C-LFR-POST. This diagram is seen in Figure \ref{c-lfr-post}.

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \widefigure
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Definitions/c-lfr-post.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram for C-LFR-POST thermal energy storage charging orientation\label{c-lfr-post}}
\end{figure}
\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

This TES charging cycle extracts heat before the turbine and therefore would have a large negative effect on the amount of work that the turbine could produce. The turbine needs to offset the requirements of both compressors and this would require the inlet temperature to be high. The amount of energy that could be extracted before the turbine would be small and therefore the heat storage efficiency would be small. There is no quantitative study done on this case because, due to the efficiency losses, it is non-viable. 

\subsubsection{C-LFR-PAR} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirement of the turbine and CSP hot TES temperature can be accomplished by splitting the flow before the turbine. The flow through the salt heat exchanger in this cycle is therefore separate from the turbine. After the salt heat exchanger a valve is needed to reduce the pressure, this TES charging cycle is C-LFR-PAR shown in Figure \ref{c-lfr-par}.

\end{paracol}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \widefigure

\end{figure}

\linenumbers
\switchcolumn

Two sensitivity studies with varying cold CSP TES are desired to see the impact on heat storage efficiency. The TES temperature study is calculated with a low TES temperature of 663.2 K and a high TES temperature of 713.2 K. 

\subsubsection{C-LFR-CIRC} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The full diagram for C-LFR-CIRC is shown in Figure \ref{c-lfr-circ}.

The charging subsection of this diagram is composed of a circulation cycle that has heat inputted through the LFR heat exchanger. This subsection is encircled in blue and can be seen in Figure \ref{c-lfr-circ-sub}.

The flow continues through a circulator which is assumed to have negligible pressure rise (i.e. there is assumed to be negligible pressure drop in this case). A heat exchanger, SALT HX, extracts heat from the flow, storing the thermal energy in the hot TES for later use. Excess heat that is not extracted is then dumped into a reservoir through the chiller to bring the temperature of the flow down to LFR cool side operating temperature of 673.2 K. Three different temperatures; 663.2 K, 683.2 K, and 713.2 K, are compared in a sensitivity study.

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1}, Table~\ref{tab1}, etc.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=10.5 cm]{Definitions/logo-mdpi}
\caption{This is a figure. Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are multiple panels, they should be listed as: (\textbf{a}) Description of what is contained in the first panel. (\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.\label{fig1}}

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}

the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\end{paracol}
\nointerlineskip
\begin{eqnarray}
a &=& b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l\nonumber \\
 &+& m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z %\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

% Example of a figure that spans the whole page width (the commands \widefigure and \begin{paracol}{2}, \linenumbers, and\switchcolumn need to be present). The same concept works for tables, too.
%\begin{figure}[H]	
%\widefigure
%\includegraphics[width=15 cm]{Definitions/logo-mdpi}
%\caption{This is a wide figure.\label{fig2}}
%\end{figure} 





\begin{paracol}{2}
\linenumbers
\switchcolumn
Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.

\end{paracol}





%Completed suggestions from Ben:

%-I would include the naming scheme upfront and give a table (C-LFR-ON etc.)

%-Here you need to explain what a conventional CSP cycle looks like (briefly). I.e. CSP charges salt, it can discharge when you want it to. Now with our configuration we introduce a 'new' charging mode where heat comes in from the SALT HX as well as from the sun, via the sCO2 Brayton as you say

%-Explain why there is no charging and discharging at same time - because if there is electricity demand heat from LFR would be dispatched direclty rather than thru the SALT HX

%-SALT HX could perhaps be better named sCO2-to-Salt or C2S for short perhaps! Np if you dont want to change it at this late stage
