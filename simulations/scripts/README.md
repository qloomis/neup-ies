# Scripts for Simulations

This folder is for Python simulaton scripts.

Because this can get clogged up fast, for now I just added all *.py files in this folder to .gitignore with 3 exceptions. 

If you'd like to upload a specific Python file, override the .gitignore by:
>git push -f

TODO: come up with a naming convention?
